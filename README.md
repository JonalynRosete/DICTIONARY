# DICTIONARY: DATA TYPES
Using a Python programming language with the guidlines of creating dictionary. Curly brackets, and colons ( to separate key-value pairs) is the most important elements in the process. The dictionary contains 30 key-value pairs, and we access values by referring to their keys (e.g., DATA["COLLABORATE"] returns "WORK TOGETHER ON A COMMON ENTERPRISE")
